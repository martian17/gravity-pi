This program uses the famous newton's gravity equation  
```JavaScript
F=G*M*m/(r^2)
```
to calculate pi.  

Demo: https://codepen.io/MartianLord/pen/MWJgrZZ  

It basically divides the orbital circumference by the diameter  
Gets surprisingly close to pi imo  

Might make one with runge kutta in the future instead of just gaussian
