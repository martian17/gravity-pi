This program uses the famous newton's gravity equation  
```JavaScript
F=G*M*m/(r^2)
```
to calculate pi.

Newton's law of universal gravity: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation  

It basically divides the orbital circumference by the diameter  
Gets surprisingly close to pi imo  

Might make one with runge kutta in the future instead of just gaussian
